<p>The 22nd of July this year marked a new milestone in the lives of 80 couples who took part in the inaugural edition of the Shin Min Timeless Promise event.</p>



<p>At the picturesque urban wedding resort setting of Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay, these couples, five of whom have been married for over 50 years, made the heartwarming decision to renew their marriage vows in the presence of their family and friends.</p>



<p>The ceremony was officiated by Justice of the Peace Mr. Toh Soon Huat, who is also the Voluntary Executive Chairman of Sian Chay Medical Institution.</p>



<p>An exclusive 4-course Peranakan luncheon menu was curated by the hotel specially for the event. Couples and guests were wrapped in the romantic atmosphere of the exquisitely decorated space. Performers Ji Xiang and Hui Bing, a couple themselves, crooned specially curated love songs that resonated with the married couples.</p>



<p>Event sponsors Frederiksdal and Resorts World Cruises provided exclusive promotions at their sponsor booths.</p>



<p>Each couple received a vow renewal certificate, a floral bouquet and a complimentary bottle of Frederiksdal Sparkling RØD cherry wine worth $109. Lucky draw prizes worth more than $3,500 — including a pair of Resorts World Cruises balcony stateroom tickets — were also given out.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overwhelming response</strong><br></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://msdx-uat.sph.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-24068" srcset="http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage.webp 800w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage-300x169.webp 300w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage-768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Readers started calling the hotline the moment the event was publicised on Shin Min, while radio listeners messaged the radio DJs of UFM100.3 and 96.3好FM to ask for the registration link.</p>



<p>The overwhelming response to the event surprised even Shin Min Daily News editor Mr. Choo Chee Wee, as they initially projected to host only 20 couples and their guests at the vow renewal ceremony.</p>



<p>He said, “As this is the first time for Shin Min to hold this event, I did not expect to have such an enthusiastic response with so many couples signing up.”</p>



<p>The event itself proved to be a resounding success, with all attendees saying they would recommend their friends and relatives to take part should it be held again next year.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Event idea inspired by wine</strong><br></h5>



<p>Mr. Choo related that the idea for the event was inspired by a wine tasting of the cherry wine produced by the Frederiksdal winery in Denmark, the event’s main sponsor.</p>



<p>Just as the mellow body of the cherry wine was developed after decades of the winemaking process, the same goes for the love of married couples who have lasted the test of time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://msdx-uat.sph.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-24070" srcset="http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2.webp 800w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2-300x169.webp 300w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2-768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>“Today’s event is the most powerful testimony of a long and lasting marriage because the requirement to participate is to be married for at least 10 years. If we calculate the total number of years our couples have been married, it would reach 2,471 years!” said Mr Choo.</p>

<p>Readers started calling the hotline the moment the event was publicised on Shin Min, while radio listeners messaged the radio DJs of UFM100.3 and 96.3好FM to ask for the registration link.</p>



<p>The overwhelming response to the event surprised even Shin Min Daily News editor Mr. Choo Chee Wee, as they initially projected to host only 20 couples and their guests at the vow renewal ceremony.</p>



<p>He said, “As this is the first time for Shin Min to hold this event, I did not expect to have such an enthusiastic response with so many couples signing up.”</p>



<p>The event itself proved to be a resounding success, with all attendees saying they would recommend their friends and relatives to take part should it be held again next year.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Event idea inspired by wine</strong><br></h5>



<p>Mr. Choo related that the idea for the event was inspired by a wine tasting of the cherry wine produced by the Frederiksdal winery in Denmark, the event’s main sponsor.</p>



<p>Just as the mellow body of the cherry wine was developed after decades of the winemaking process, the same goes for the love of married couples who have lasted the test of time.</p>

<p>“Today’s event is the most powerful testimony of a long and lasting marriage because the requirement to participate is to be married for at least 10 years. If we calculate the total number of years our couples have been married, it would reach 2,471 years!” said Mr Choo.</p>

<p>The 22nd of July this year marked a new milestone in the lives of 80 couples who took part in the inaugural edition of the Shin Min Timeless Promise event.</p>



<p>At the picturesque urban wedding resort setting of Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay, these couples, five of whom have been married for over 50 years, made the heartwarming decision to renew their marriage vows in the presence of their family and friends.</p>



<p>The ceremony was officiated by Justice of the Peace Mr. Toh Soon Huat, who is also the Voluntary Executive Chairman of Sian Chay Medical Institution.</p>



<p>An exclusive 4-course Peranakan luncheon menu was curated by the hotel specially for the event. Couples and guests were wrapped in the romantic atmosphere of the exquisitely decorated space. Performers Ji Xiang and Hui Bing, a couple themselves, crooned specially curated love songs that resonated with the married couples.</p>



<p>Event sponsors Frederiksdal and Resorts World Cruises provided exclusive promotions at their sponsor booths.</p>



<p>Each couple received a vow renewal certificate, a floral bouquet and a complimentary bottle of Frederiksdal Sparkling RØD cherry wine worth $109. Lucky draw prizes worth more than $3,500 — including a pair of Resorts World Cruises balcony stateroom tickets — were also given out.</p>

<p><strong>Singapore, 21 May 2023 </strong>- Lianhe Zaobao (ZB), the flagship Chinese-language daily of SPH Media, has launched a virtual comics exhibition to celebrate its centennial anniversary. The exhibition was officially opened today by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, at One Punggol Hawker Centre.</p>



<p>The exhibition, titled "Scenes of Singapore Life (生活百态线上漫画展)," will showcase 100 works by ZB’s comic artists. These comics present a thoughtful and humorous look at the everyday life of Singaporeans, covering &nbsp; areas&nbsp; such as food, environment, transportation, technology and the Covid-19 pandemic. The comics, with English translations, are available online on&nbsp; ZB’s interactive website <a href="https://bit.ly/zaobao100-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://bit.ly/zaobao100-comics</a>.</p>



<p>Members of the public can scan the QR code on the stickers to view all 100 works online. The public can also take part in a Vote-n-Win contest by voting for their favourite comics to win shopping vouchers. A total of 10 participants will stand to win $50 worth of shopping vouchers each week during the exhibition period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr Tan Chong Beng, Visual Director, Chinese Media Group, SPH Media, who is one of the 10 featured comic artists for this exhibition, said: “Comics have evolved over time from print to digital, but they still serve the purpose of adding humour to make newspaper reading fun and interesting. I hope that our creative contributions will continue to provide readers with memorable reading experiences.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 22nd of July this year marked a new milestone in the lives of 80 couples who took part in the inaugural edition of the Shin Min Timeless Promise event.</p>



<p>At the picturesque urban wedding resort setting of Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay, these couples, five of whom have been married for over 50 years, made the heartwarming decision to renew their marriage vows in the presence of their family and friends.</p>



<p>The ceremony was officiated by Justice of the Peace Mr. Toh Soon Huat, who is also the Voluntary Executive Chairman of Sian Chay Medical Institution.</p>



<p>An exclusive 4-course Peranakan luncheon menu was curated by the hotel specially for the event. Couples and guests were wrapped in the romantic atmosphere of the exquisitely decorated space. Performers Ji Xiang and Hui Bing, a couple themselves, crooned specially curated love songs that resonated with the married couples.</p>



<p>Event sponsors Frederiksdal and Resorts World Cruises provided exclusive promotions at their sponsor booths.</p>



<p>Each couple received a vow renewal certificate, a floral bouquet and a complimentary bottle of Frederiksdal Sparkling RØD cherry wine worth $109. Lucky draw prizes worth more than $3,500 — including a pair of Resorts World Cruises balcony stateroom tickets — were also given out.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overwhelming response</strong><br></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://msdx-uat.sph.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-24068" srcset="http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage.webp 800w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage-300x169.webp 300w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage-768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Readers started calling the hotline the moment the event was publicised on Shin Min, while radio listeners messaged the radio DJs of UFM100.3 and 96.3好FM to ask for the registration link.</p>



<p>The overwhelming response to the event surprised even Shin Min Daily News editor Mr. Choo Chee Wee, as they initially projected to host only 20 couples and their guests at the vow renewal ceremony.</p>



<p>He said, “As this is the first time for Shin Min to hold this event, I did not expect to have such an enthusiastic response with so many couples signing up.”</p>



<p>The event itself proved to be a resounding success, with all attendees saying they would recommend their friends and relatives to take part should it be held again next year.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Event idea inspired by wine</strong><br></h5>



<p>Mr. Choo related that the idea for the event was inspired by a wine tasting of the cherry wine produced by the Frederiksdal winery in Denmark, the event’s main sponsor.</p>



<p>Just as the mellow body of the cherry wine was developed after decades of the winemaking process, the same goes for the love of married couples who have lasted the test of time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://msdx-uat.sph.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-24070" srcset="http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2.webp 800w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2-300x169.webp 300w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2-768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>“Today’s event is the most powerful testimony of a long and lasting marriage because the requirement to participate is to be married for at least 10 years. If we calculate the total number of years our couples have been married, it would reach 2,471 years!” said Mr Choo.</p>

<p>The 22nd of July this year marked a new milestone in the lives of 80 couples who took part in the inaugural edition of the Shin Min Timeless Promise event.</p>



<p>At the picturesque urban wedding resort setting of Paradox Singapore Merchant Court at Clarke Quay, these couples, five of whom have been married for over 50 years, made the heartwarming decision to renew their marriage vows in the presence of their family and friends.</p>



<p>The ceremony was officiated by Justice of the Peace Mr. Toh Soon Huat, who is also the Voluntary Executive Chairman of Sian Chay Medical Institution.</p>



<p>An exclusive 4-course Peranakan luncheon menu was curated by the hotel specially for the event. Couples and guests were wrapped in the romantic atmosphere of the exquisitely decorated space. Performers Ji Xiang and Hui Bing, a couple themselves, crooned specially curated love songs that resonated with the married couples.</p>



<p>Event sponsors Frederiksdal and Resorts World Cruises provided exclusive promotions at their sponsor booths.</p>



<p>Each couple received a vow renewal certificate, a floral bouquet and a complimentary bottle of Frederiksdal Sparkling RØD cherry wine worth $109. Lucky draw prizes worth more than $3,500 — including a pair of Resorts World Cruises balcony stateroom tickets — were also given out.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overwhelming response</strong><br></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://msdx-uat.sph.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-24068" srcset="http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage.webp 800w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage-300x169.webp 300w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_headerimage-768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Readers started calling the hotline the moment the event was publicised on Shin Min, while radio listeners messaged the radio DJs of UFM100.3 and 96.3好FM to ask for the registration link.</p>



<p>The overwhelming response to the event surprised even Shin Min Daily News editor Mr. Choo Chee Wee, as they initially projected to host only 20 couples and their guests at the vow renewal ceremony.</p>



<p>He said, “As this is the first time for Shin Min to hold this event, I did not expect to have such an enthusiastic response with so many couples signing up.”</p>



<p>The event itself proved to be a resounding success, with all attendees saying they would recommend their friends and relatives to take part should it be held again next year.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Event idea inspired by wine</strong><br></h5>



<p>Mr. Choo related that the idea for the event was inspired by a wine tasting of the cherry wine produced by the Frederiksdal winery in Denmark, the event’s main sponsor.</p>



<p>Just as the mellow body of the cherry wine was developed after decades of the winemaking process, the same goes for the love of married couples who have lasted the test of time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://msdx-uat.sph.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-24070" srcset="http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2.webp 800w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2-300x169.webp 300w, http://s3-dsgm-msd-uat.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/SMTimelessPromise_couple2-768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>“Today’s event is the most powerful testimony of a long and lasting marriage because the requirement to participate is to be married for at least 10 years. If we calculate the total number of years our couples have been married, it would reach 2,471 years!” said Mr Choo.</p>

Mr Lee Syafiq Muhd Ridzuan Lee, 30, clinched this award for his perseverance to sustain and expand his hawker business during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. To date, he owns six gourmet burger outlets in Singapore and one outlet in New York. He said: “This award came as a huge surprise to me as I did not expect to be awarded with such a prestigious title and award. It is an honour to be able to receive it and to represent the younger generation of entrepreneurs who are working hard to achieve their goals and ambition especially in a hawker setting. ‘Sikit sikit jadi bukit’&nbsp;<em>(Translation: "Little by little it becomes a hill")</em>.”</p>



<p>This year, to celebrate its 65th anniversary, Berita Harian also presented the Lifetime Achiever&nbsp;<em>(Anugerah Jauhari Pencapaian Sepanjang Hayat Berita Harian)</em>&nbsp;Award that recognises individuals for their lifetime accomplishments. This award was presented to the grandfather of Malay songs in Southeast Asia, 85-year-old Mohamed Noor Mohamed Yusofe. Better known as Yusnor Ef, he had penned hundreds of Malay songs. Mr Yusnor said: “I feel honoured and very happy with this recognition. I hope to set an example to the younger generations through my works, to always remember the past, create the present and inspire the future”.
